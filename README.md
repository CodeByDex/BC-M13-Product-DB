# BC-M13-Product-DB
AS A manager at an internet retail company I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies


## How
To use this app you will need to run the db/schema.sql file to generate the database.
You will need to establish a .env file with the db connection info with the following format
```
DB_NAME = "ecommerce_db"
DB_USER = "<Insert App User>"
DB_PW = "<Insert App Password>"
```
